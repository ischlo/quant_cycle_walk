# Folder structure

The folder `scripts` contains all the main set of scripts to reproduce
the results of the work on cycling networks for London. Some additional
script used for analysis and post-processing are within the other
folders dedicated to the analysis. The folder `reproducibility` contains
a set of functions that run the scripts in the right order to reproduce
the results. The are in a way ‘meta-scripts’ that call the scripts that
actually contain the data engineering and analysis in the right order.

# Reproducibility

Aiming to have a reproducible workflow, we provide the necessary to be
able to reproduce as much as possible, given potential constraints
related to data sharing and other computational limitations. After
revisions, most of this work can be reproduced on an average power
personal laptop.

## Prerequisites

You will need recent versions of **R** (\> 4.0.0) and **python** (\>
3.8) for better results.

In order to set up and run this code, you need to first download the
github repository. To do so, either manually, or open a terminal and run
the following command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ischlo/quant_cycle_walk.git
```

## Data

Due to it’s size, the data is stored separately and needs to be
downloaded and added to the repository. The data can be downloaded [from
this
dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/12wujf7u0zbwl36/AADxBo7yrF6BerpkexKTmfKja?dl=0).
It contains copies of openly available data sets that were downloaded at
the time of the work. The description in the
[`data/`](https://github.com/ischlo/quant_cycle_walk/tree/git_ssh/data)
folder shows the original links from which the data can be downloaded if
it is not generated by a script.

## Network setup

The workflow is divided into 3 main parts, first the network set up, it
uses data downloaded from [OSM](openstreetmap.org) with the *OSMNx*
package in python to get the network data. It will download 3 networks
for the different profiles considered in this work: *cycling*, *walking*
and *all*.

Run the following command in terminal to launch the network download
process.

``` bash
python3 /scripts/network/data_import.py
```

Or, using the provided data sets (pre downloaded, but in raw format.)
run the `network_setup.R` from the reproducibility folder. It will set
up already routable networks for all the profiles considered in the
work.

## Routing setup

The routing setup requires pre processing of the London MSOA data, we
need to find the different centroids. Run `area_setup.R` from the
reproducibility folder to do that. The routing process will take the
previously produced networks, do some preprocessing on them, find the
nodes from which the routing will be done, and generate distance
matrices. It will also produce summary statistics of the networks.

## Modelling setup

The spatial interaction model part of the work originally relied on a
set of R functions to be run, but since then, a package was made that
has an increased performance and allows to run these models on smaller
machines quickly. The model outputs with both methods are the same.
These changes have been incorporated since to allow for easier
reproducibility. Run `test_env.R` to do the gravity models and analysis
of this section. This will populate the directory with the outputs and
results that are shown in the paper.

# Session info

Here is the basic information about the R it was last run on.

``` r
R.version
```

Additionally, the user can set up the environment with the package
versions used with the `renv::restore()` command, assuming
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) is
installed.

The final step is to download the two packages that developed during
this work, they are on github, and not yet on CRAN, one might not even
end up there as it contains a few support functions that i found useful
for my own workflows.  
To download them, run:

``` r
# support functions for various tasks
remotes::install_github('ischlo/Btoolkit')

# fast and efficient spatial interaction models.
remotes::install_github('ischlo/cppSim')
```

# Images

The images illustrate the number of users by transport mode at MSOA
level. This work will focus on pedestrians and cyclists.
